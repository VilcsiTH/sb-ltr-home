# Todo
Priority | Task
------------ | -------------
Low | <ul><li>- [ ] Add safe-randomization mode (Prevents certain items from being unobtainable)</li></ul>
High | <ul><li>- [ ] Randomization selection (Select which types of drops should be randomized)</li></ul>
High | <ul><li>- [ ] Resourcepack randomization (Pretty much what you think it is)</li></ul>
